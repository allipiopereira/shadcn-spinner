# Shadcn Spinner
Inspired by the Radix UI.

Try now: https://shadcn-spinner.vercel.app

The `shadcn-spinner` is a lightweight and customizable loading spinner component, designed to be easily integrated into projects based on **shadcn**.

## New! Shadcn CLI Support

You can now add the `shadcn-spinner` directly via the shadcn CLI! ðŸŽ‰

Thanks to the latest **shadcn** update and the contribution from [@BramSuurdje](https://github.com/BramSuurdje), it's now even easier to integrate our component into your project.

### How to use

Run the following command in the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn add https://shadcn-spinner.vercel.app/api/r/spinner
```

Now just use it.

```tsx
<Spinner size="sm" className="bg-black dark:bg-white" />
```
